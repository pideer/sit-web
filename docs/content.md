# About Us
SIT Accounting Services began in 2008 with a passion for helping low-income individuals accurately and confidently file their tax returns. What began as a mission to serve individuals in need has grown into a full-service accounting firm supporting businesses, entrepreneurs, and high-income clients with comprehensive tax preparation and financial services.

Over the years, we have remained committed to personalized service, integrity, and financial clarity for every client we serve.

**Experience & Values**

We have been CPA licensed since 2005, providing both the legal authority and professional expertise to prepare your taxes accurately and effectively. We also hold a Master’s degree in Finance and Accounting from the University of Maryland. Our firm is committed to building lasting relationships with our clients and helping them stay financially focused and confident in their decisions. Outside the office, we are dedicated plant growers, frequent walkers, and have even completed a half-marathon.
